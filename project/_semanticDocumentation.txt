Welcome to the documentation for the semanitic analysis:

Basically, I copied my CST code and used that to create an AST.
There were a few complications that came with that, like with boolean
expressions. It may have been easier to deal with them using another
method to create the AST.

After working on the AST, I decided to edit the same file and build
the symbol table at the same time. In hindsight, it might have 
been a lot neater to copy the AST files and generate another AST
instead of just clouding up the AST file.

To enable verbose mode, go into the main.cpp file and follow the
instructions in the comments to select what level of
verbosity you want for each option.
