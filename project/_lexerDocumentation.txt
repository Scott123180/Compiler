Additional documentation on the lexer:

Building the project:
Use the command "make all" to build the project in it's entirety. The output will be in the format of a file
called "test1"

Running the project:
./test1  [file of your choice as input]

Flow of control:
1. When the program is invoked via the CLI, an input file name must be specified for the lexer so that testcases 
   can be run. 

2.A few initialization variables and data structures are defined in the main file for determining input.

3. After this, a line is taken in as a whole, then looped through, character by character. During this
process of looping, 
	a. each character is checked as a valid symbol
	b. conditionals are checked on the symbol to determine if it is a symbol that separates tokens and/or
           is itself a token
        c. If it cannot be immediately determined, the symbol will be added to a buffer, which iself can
	   later be flushed and turned into a token.

4. If a token's type is unknown, the token is crafted using the token class and an overloaded method which
   determines what type it is and/or any errors in it. Tokens are added to a vector of token objects.

5. Once the end of the file is reached, the lexer generates list of tokens and prints out
   any respective meta-information to an html file called "lexer.html". In this way it is easy to ensure neat-ish
   output formatting that is not just in the command prompt.

E. Any errors output will be written to the command line and additional information will be given to the
   user in order to remedy the problem.
