Welcome to the semantic testing documentation:

I've written many testcases in the directory project/testcases/my_cases/semantic

There are a few folders with formal files. I've initialized most all of them and run them
with the expected results for a few hours. I've found that most of my issues were with type
checking in boolean expressions. Thus, most of my testcases target those. There are a lot
of possibilities, and so I covered enough to be relatively sure that my program functions
well.

I've also tested the examples in the rubric and they work as expected.
