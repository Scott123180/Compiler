So I've borrowed and moddified a few test cases from the all star projects and here are the results.

Saving any lapses in judgement, the lexer should be fully functional. I've tested it with many use cases
and have found that it does not accept symbols that are not defined in their respective scopes. The program 
does not accept erronious symbols in general, but also checks for invalid symbols in character arrays.

I have also tested the program for run on quotation marks and returns an error if there are any. The files that
are in the diretory labeled "testcases" contain a few programs which I've been modifying to fit a variety of
tests.

The program works with sequential programs as specified in the requirements, but this can easily be changed
if need be.
